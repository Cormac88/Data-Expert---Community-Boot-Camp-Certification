# Spotify: User Journey & Proposed Experiments

## 🎧 User Journey --- From First Use to Today

### 🟢 1. First Encounter

When I first started using **Spotify**, the onboarding flow felt
effortless. The interface was clean, the signup process was
frictionless, and I was immediately pulled into exploring music.

**What stood out**: - Quick, intuitive onboarding - Strong early
personalization (even with minimal data) - Smooth syncing between mobile
and desktop

### 🟢 2. Early Usage: Discovery & Personalization

Over time, personalization became the core delight. Spotify's
recommendations adapted quickly as I explored genres, skipped tracks,
and saved favorites.

**What I loved**: - **Discover Weekly** and **Release Radar** felt
surprisingly accurate - The blend of editorial and algorithmic
playlists - Seamless playlist creation and customization

### 🟢 3. Mature Usage: Everyday Integration

Today Spotify is part of my daily rhythm---work, commute, workouts,
sleep.

**Key strengths now**: - **Spotify Connect** enabling multi-device
control - **Cross-device session continuity** - **Yearly Wrapped**:
engaging, emotional, shareable - Highly relevant day-to-day personalized
mixes

## 🎧 Product Experiments to Improve Experience

Below are three structured experiments designed to measure potential
improvements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Experiment 1: Adaptive "Energy Mode" Playlist Tuning

**Goal:** Improve the perceived accuracy of recommendations for workouts
or focus activities.

### 🔬 Test Cells

  Cell          Condition
  ------------- --------------------------------------------------------------
  A (Control)   Existing playlist algorithm
  B             Playlist dynamically adjusts energy based on skip rate
  C             User-adjustable "energy slider" to influence recommendations

### 📊 Metrics

**Leading:** - Skip rate during sessions - Average session duration -
Tracks saved from the playlist

**Lagging:** - Day-7 retention - Playlist replay frequency -
Cross-device listening

### 🧪 Hypothesis

Users engaged in workouts or focus sessions will see reduced skips and
longer sessions when energy is adaptive or user-controlled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Experiment 2: Social Listening Rooms

**Goal:** Drive social engagement and increase discovery via friends.

### 🔬 Test Cells

  Cell          Condition
  ------------- --------------------------------
  A (Control)   No social listening rooms
  B             Audio-only listening rooms
  C             Rooms + text chat
  D             Rooms + chat + emoji reactions

### 📊 Metrics

**Leading:** - Number of rooms created - Time spent in rooms -
Invitations sent

**Lagging:** - Followers gained - Repeat room usage rate - Songs added
via friends

### 🧪 Hypothesis

Lightweight social features (like reactions) will significantly increase
time spent and repeat usage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Experiment 3: Personalized "Morning Jumpstart" Tile

**Goal:** Increase morning activation and encourage daily listening
habits.

### 🔬 Test Cells

  Cell          Condition
  ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  A (Control)   Current home screen
  B             Morning-specific playlist tile
  C             Playlist + short-form news/updates
  D             Fully adaptive tile based on user's morning mood/patterns

### 📊 Metrics

**Leading:** - Tile click-through rate - Morning session starts

**Lagging:** - Daily active users (morning cohort) - Total listening
time - Week 1 / Week 4 retention

### 🧪 Hypothesis

A contextual morning entry point reduces friction and reinforces habit
loops, improving retention.
